About configuration files
-------------------------

The configuration files we describe are bundle-specific files without dependence on application configuration.  
For example, in AcmeDemoBundle the configuration file is `src/Acme/DemoBundle/Resources/config/sample.yml`, etc.  
The purpose of this bundle is to cache files like this.
